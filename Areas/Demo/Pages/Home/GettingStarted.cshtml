                <h3>Rest APIs and Acumatica Cloud ERP</h3>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    Acumatica ERP provides web services for integration with external systems. Through the web services of Acumatica ERP, external systems
                    can get data records from Acumatica ERP, process these records, and save new or updated records to Acumatica ERP. To access these web services, you can use the
                    contract-based<dfn><b>Re</b>presentational <b>S</b>tate <b>T</b>ransfer (ReST) API</dfn>, the contract-based SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) application programming interface (API), and the
                    screen-based SOAP API. Rest APIs are used by this demonstration application. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    Acumatica ERP has full support for the Rest Open APIs which is made possible using contract-based web services. For general information on the contract-based web services,
                    see <a href="https://help/acumatica.com" target="_blank">Acumatica Help</a>. 
                    The following image shows the different levels of contract based api's that are supported in Acumatica ERP.
                </p>
                <img src="~/img/AcumaticaERP_IntegrationDevelopmentGuide.jpg" style="width:65vw; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    Also see the Integration Development Guide which can be found on the Acumatica Help site. It has a comprehensive explanation of the web services and web service endpoints or
                    contracts which enable Acumatica ERP to integrate with external systems.
                </p>
                <h4>Endpoints and Contracts</h4>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    An endpoint is an entry point to the Acumatica ERP web services. For each endpoint that a web service API provides, a contract of the
                    endpoint defines the entities, with their actions and fields, that are
                    available through the endpoint and the methods that you can use to work with these entities. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    These endpoints are identified by the URL that you use to access the web services. For example, the endpoint shown in the following image has the version 24.200.001 and the name Default.
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    <img src="~/img/webendpoints.png" style="width:65vw; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    This version of the Default endpoint defines the contract based implementation of the API and the list of entities, with their actions and fields you can work with through this version of this endpoint. 
                    The contract of an endpoint is identified by contract version. The version of a contract defines the list of methods for working with
                    entities that you can use when working with Acumatica ERP through the endpoint with this version of the contract.
                </p>
                <h4>API Entities, Fields, and Actions</h4>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    The contract of an endpoint defines the following elements of the contract-based web services API: entities, fields, and actions.
                </p>
                <h4>Entities</h4>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    An entity corresponds to a business logic object that you are going to work with. For example, the contract of a system endpoint includes
                    the Warehouse entity, which represents a warehouse and holds the data related to the warehouse. This entity is associated with the Warehouses (IN204000) form. For
                    a custom endpoint, if you are going to use an entity to transfer data to or from Acumatica ERP, you should associate this entity with a particular
                    Acumatica ERP form. For example, you can create a Vendor entity, which represents a vendor. This entity is associated with the Vendor (AP303000) form. 
                </p>
                <h4>Fields</h4>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    The fields of an entity correspond to the parameters of a business logic object. For example, the Warehouse Description and fields, among others. 
                    In the contract, these fields are mapped to the Description and the elements of the Summary area of the Warehouses form. 
                    For a custom endpoint, if you need to connect the field with a particular element on an Acumatica ERP form, you should map the field to this element. 
                    For example, if you have created the Vendor entity, which designates a vendor, you can add the field VendorID to the entity
                    and connect this field with the Vendor ID element of the Summary area of the Vendors form.
                </p>
                <h4>Actions</h4>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    The actions of an entity correspond to the actions that can be applied to a business logic object. For example, the TransferOrder entity,
                    which is available through the system endpoint, has the ReleaseTransferOrder action. This action corresponds to the Release button on the form toolbar of the Transfers (IN304000) form. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    For a custom endpoint, if you need to use an Acumatica ERP action, you should add this action to the contract of the custom endpoint with
                    the needed parameters. For example, suppose you want to add an action that changes the customer ID of an existing customer, you can add the action <i>ChangeID</i>
                    and map it to the Change ID action, which is available on the Customers form. The new action should have one parameter, which specifies the new ID of a customer as the Change ID action has. 
                </p>
                <h4>Using the Web Endpoints and Contracts</h4>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    First, export a specific web endpoint into a json formatted file using the OpenAPI 2.0 tool in the Service Definition menu in the Web Service Endpoint form (SM207060).
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    This representation of the endpoint can be used to generate C# classes that then can be used to make the Rest API calls.
                </p>
                <h4>Acumatica Rest API Client</h4>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    Acumatica has created a NuGet package for the API Client and all the latest Endpoints available in Acumatica ERP. This package has transformed
                    the json definitions available for all the Acumatica web service endpoints into C# classes that can be used very naturally to interact with an Acumatica ERP instance..
                    The API Client is utilized by this application.
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    The Acumatica Rest API Client is also publicly available on github.com. It uses an Open-Source project called RestSharp. The RestSharp is also publicly available on github.com.
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">
                    The transformation of the json file into actual C# classes can be performed in a few ways, namely: OpenCodeGenerator, NSwag, or even on swagger.io.
                    The code generator was utilized in the API Client project. More information regarding this all is in the ReadMe.md file on github.com.

                                Acumatica ERP provides web services for integration with external systems. 
                                Through the web services of Acumatica ERP, external systems can get data records from Acumatica ERP, 
                                process these records, and save new or updated records to Acumatica ERP.
                                To access these web services, you can use the contract-based representational state transfer (REST) API, 
                                the contract-based SOAP application programming interface (API), 
                                and the screen-based SOAP API. The main concepts related to the contract-based SOAP API and the contract-based REST API.

                                The contract-based web service APIs operate with business logic objects that do not depend on Acumatica ERP forms or their properties and methods. 
                                (In this context, contract-based means based on the object model the web service API provides.) 
                                Each web service contract is fixed and does not change based on system customization, localization, or any other changes made to Acumatica ERP.

                                Acumatica ERP provides you with the contract-based REST APIs of web service endpoints and with the contract-based REST API of an Acumatica ERP instance. 
                                The methods of a REST API are provided in a swagger.json file, which is an OpenAPI 2.0 (formerly known as Swagger 2.0) file. 
                                For more information about the OpenAPI specification, see https://www.openapis.org. 
                                You can use the swagger.json files to review the APIs of the instance and endpoints and build the client applications for Acumatica ERP based on these files.

                                By using the contract-based REST API, you obtain existing records from Acumatica ERP, create new records, update, and delete them. 
                                You work with the records in Acumatica ERP by using the entities that are defined in the contract of the endpoint that you use to access the service. 
                                You pass records to and receive them from the contract-based REST API in JavaScript object notation (JSON) format. 
                                JSON is a text format for transmitting data objects that consist of key-value pairs.
